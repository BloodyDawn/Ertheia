Calling all adventurers! Dolphren is looking for brave warriors to help collect research materials! Listen in for details.<br><br>
Research on the Giant relics is progressing at a somewhat slower pace than expected, as our efforts have been increasingly hampered by the emerging monster threats and ongoing wars.<br>
To help, Dolphren has suggested concentrating on the <font color="LEVEL">Silent Valley</font> and has offered significant compensation for all those who agree to help!<br><br>
Are you interested?<br>
