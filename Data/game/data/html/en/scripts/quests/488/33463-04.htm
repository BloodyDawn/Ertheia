Good. Let's go over everyting.<br><br>
Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">Chimera Pieces, Soldier of Ancient Times, Changed Creations, Warrior of Ancient Times, Shaman of Ancient Times, Anciet Creature, Forgotten Ancient People, Forgotten Face, and Giant's shadow</font>, all found in the Silent Valley, until you find a <font color="LEVEL">50 Relic Boxes</font>. Then return to Aden and give the boxes to <font color="LEVEL">Recipe Merchant Dolphren</font> - he will deem whether or not your task has been carried out to his satisfaction, and pay you if so.
