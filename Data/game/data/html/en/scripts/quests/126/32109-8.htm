<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
Actually, I am simply binding you to the oath on Shilen's behalf... She and she alone can give you Gazkh.<br>
You undoubtedly know that Shilen suffered unspeakable tragedy after the seal of Sailren. The poor goddess was abandoned by her parents 
and brothers and sisters, shunned and transformed into the goddess of death. The world today has forgoteen how wise and powerful Shilen was. 
Were she still the water goddess, the chaos rampant in the world would be far less than it is.<br>
