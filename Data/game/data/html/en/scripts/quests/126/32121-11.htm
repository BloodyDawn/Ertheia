Here is the wisdom that you seek!<br>
Outsider of fate, Shilen's will is that you now travel to the Warrior's Grave and pray for it with a true heart. Then you will recieve what you require.<br>
The grave lies at the end of the southwest area. Take this fragment of Gazkh that you showed me, whose memories have revealed this wisdom to me.<br>
If only you could restore the fragment to its rightful master!
