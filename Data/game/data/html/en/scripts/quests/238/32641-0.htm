<html><body>Dr. Helvatice:<br>
Although I gave you the Reed Field Development Research Certificate, I cannot trust you 100%. but if you could do this <font color="LEVEL">favor</font> for me, I will be able to trust you completely.<br>
If you can succesfully carry this out, you not only don't have to bring along the certificate cumbersomely, but I also should be able to putyou on the mission given from the base.<br>
