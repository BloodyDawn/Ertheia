In all things, you must keep a positive outlook... tell yourself that we CAN do this.<br>
Capturing Sakum isn't an easy task. All we have so far are rumors and conflicting information on what the creature looks like now. Anyone who has actually seen the beast can't give us an accurate sketch of the creature that doesn't look like it was done by a 4 year old child with a broken hand. So we haven't been able to make accurate wanted posters for the thing.<br>
It would be helpful if you can find me anything we can use to get an accurate image of the beast. Think you can do this?<br>
