Sir Eric Rodemai:
<br>
Very good! Slaughter
<font color="LEVEL"> Shillien Priest Hisilrome </font>
and bring me her Hearth!
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I told you before, you don't have to kill her yourself!</font>
There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Shillien Priest Hisilrome and then bring her Hearth to me.
