Excellent. Now to review the mission...<br>
Kill <font color="LEVEL">Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights, and Shrine Guards</font> in the Shrine of Loyalty until you have collected <font color="LEVEL">77 Traces of Evil</font>. Then report back to <font color="LEVEL">Priest Bastian</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Goddard</font>. He will take the samples and pay you for your time.<br>
