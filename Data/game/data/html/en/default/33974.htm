The Dimensional Warp was created when the energy, which brought Faeron to the Material Realm from the Wind Spirit Realm, accumulated in one place. Only a party of <font color="LEVEL">4 or less</font> and at <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 99</font> may enter. Each team requires at least <font color="LEVEL">12 Warp Crystals</font>.<br1>
    Rare bracelets and fragments of an ancient tome can be found there. Do you want to go there?<br>
